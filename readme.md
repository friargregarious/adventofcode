## Personal Project

Writing a script to:

1. get year and day for selected puzzle from user
2. authenticate with adeventofcode.com
3. grab instructions & inputs for given day/year
4. create a new working folder for given day/year
5. poplulate working folder with directions.md (markdown version of html from site)
6. poplulate working folder with input.txt (from site)
7. create python file from template for given day

This should be really cool, if I can figure out the OAuth1 portion of the project.

## Backdated

Went back to the old puzzles to do them as I while away the hours till tomorrow's puzzle.
